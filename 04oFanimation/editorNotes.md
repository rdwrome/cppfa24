* have a common style of output (in terms of animations)
* can we get rights for a screenshot of masahiko sato curves DVD ?
* where are chapters 9, 10, & 11?
  * maybe rename remaining chapters for consitency?
* consistent coding style in examples (K&R, 1TBS are mixed)
* removed section "local interactions lead to global behavior"
  * no content beside non-descriptive screenshot
  * models and emergent behaviour warrant their own chapter (besides "classic" animation)
