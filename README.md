### ALL DUE DATES ARE IN UNDER THE "ASSIGNMENTS" SECTION IN CANVAS

### Steps to submit via GitHub+Canvas
  1. Make a subfolder in *your* GitHub repository named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/itp/scratch, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (i.e. code+documentation) into that subfolder
  3. Submit the link for that folder into the appropriate Canvas Assignment

### Documentation outline
  - The documentation (**always** in Markdown as a .md file) must have the following:
    - what you did
    - how you did it
    - the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
    - how you overcame them
    - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
      - other folks' GitHub public repositories and [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are the best places to go for help most of the time
      - *do not* submit paywalled links
      - *if* you submit YouTube links (which is discouraged), they must have TIME STAMPS
    - Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
    - For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.
    - In general (unless I specify otherwise), it is permissible to use chat-GPT under the following circumstances:
      - You download the interaction and upload it to your GitHub repository named after the assignment.
      - You write out *in your own words* your understanding of what you learned from using chat-GPT in your Documentation File.

- I don't necessarily answer emails outside of working hours (M-F, 9-5)
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- In an emergency, please call me (really).
