# let's start from the very beginning

## [C++ vs the world](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/c++11.html)
- around since 1983 
- balance of performance and clarity
- great for 3rd party libraries, device support and general acceptance
- more modern languages (such as JavaScript and C#) use the concept of a 'virtual machine', which receives and processes program instructions like a real machine, but allows for all sorts of ideas which don't directly translate to silicon electronics, such as dynamic typing and reflection. The virtual machine abstracts the constraints of the processor away from the thinking of the programmer.
- C++ does not have a virtual machine, which (for the time being) often gives it a performance edge over these newer languages. It is quite strict in that the instructions you type deep down have a 1:1 translation with physical processor instructions. This gives the language some inflexibilities, but means that code can be both understood naturally by a human, and clearly translate to machine code.
